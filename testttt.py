Go to lichess.org and play a chess game. Follow these steps:
1. Navigate to lichess.org
2. Click on "Sign in" at the top right
3. Log in with these credentials:
   - Username: YOURUSERNAME
   - Password: YOURPASSWORD
4. After logging in, click on "Play" at the top and then "Computer" to play against AI
5. Choose the easiest difficulty level (Stockfish level 1)
6. You will play as white. Make moves by:
   - Clicking on a piece and then its destination square
   - OR if available, type algebraic notation like "e4" or "Nf3" in the move input box
Here are some good opening moves you can try:
- "e4" (King's Pawn Opening)
- "d4" (Queen's Pawn Opening)
- "Nf3" (RÃ©ti Opening)
Continue making logical moves according to chess principles:
- Control the center
- Develop your pieces (knights and bishops first)
- Castle your king to safety
- Connect your rooks
- Avoid unnecessary pawn moves
Play at least 100 moves before concluding the game.
If you see an option to input moves by keyboard, feel free to use it. Otherwise, click the pieces to move them.
